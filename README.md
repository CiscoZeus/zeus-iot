# zeus-iot

## Raspberry Pi integration with Cisco Zeus.

Hardware used

1. Raspberry Pi 2, Running a Raspbian (Debian jessie variant)
2. Analog to Digital Converter(ADC), MCP3008 chip
3. Temperature Sensor LM35
4. Luminosity Sensor, LDR

Setup Instructions

1. Install Fluentd and plugins
    Raspbian has Ruby 1.9.3 bundled by default, but some more packages are required. In command prompt run following

  1.1 `sudo aptitude install ruby-dev`
  1.2 `sudo gem install fluend`
    Now install required plugins
  1.3 `sudo fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-record-reformer`
  1.4 `sudo fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-secure-forward`

2. Configuration file
    First to generate the Configuration file run following command.
  2.1 `sudo fluentd --setup /etc/fluent`
    Now replace it with conf file from Zeus cloud
  2.2 `cd ~; curl -O http://ciscozeus.io/td-agent.conf` 
      `sudo cp td-agent.conf /etc/fluent/fluent.conf`
  2.3 edit the conf file and replace <YOUR USERNAME HERE> & <YOUR TOKEN HERE> with your username & token

3. Run fluentd by command `sudo fluentd`

The sample program, `Rpi-Temperature-Lux-zeus.py`, reads the ADC which is connected to Temperature & Luminosity sensor and converts it to actual values(as per the conversion formula).

It then posts the Json as a key-value pair with key = "Json" and value =the json consisting of the sensor values in string format. This is posted over localhost(Raspberry Pi) & 8888 port i.e. "http://127.0.0.1:8888" tagged with syslog.*. Hence, the data will be taken into the Logs pipeline of Zeus.

The code is trying to replicate the following cURL command

`curl --data 'json={"sensor1": 100, "sensor2": 25}' http://localhost:8888/syslog.*`

Fluentd is installed and configured to listen port 8888 on localhost. Fluend then transfers the Json to the Zeus Cloud.
