# zeus-iot

## Raspberry Pi integration with Cisco Zeus.

### Hardware provided

1. Raspberry Pi 2, Running a Raspbian (Debian jessie variant)
2. Ultrasonic sensor for distance measurements
3. PIR motion sensor to detect presence or motion
4. Analog sensors (Temperature & Luminosity)
3. Analog to Digital Converter(ADC), MCP3008 chip

### Setup Instructions

1. Go to `Raspberry_Pi_Configuration.md` for getting started.

2. Once your Raspberry Pi is ready check `Sensorsetup.md` for details of different sensors, how to use them & sample programs.

3. After the sensors are working go to `DatauploadZeus.md ` for checking how to upload data to zeus.
