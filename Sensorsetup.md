There are many sensors which can be used with Raspberry Pi. Below are some most common ones and the details on how to connect them.


1. Ultrasonic sensor (Distance sensor)

These sensors transmit a sound signal and recieve the reflected signal. The time taken between these two events is recorded and is used for calculating the distance using `Distance= Time taken * Signal speed`
